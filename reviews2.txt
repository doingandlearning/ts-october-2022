Review Exercise 2 
=================
one and a quarter hours - until tea break

Interpret however you like - individual or teamwork, show-and-tell after

Build an app to retrieve user data from the API at
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

You will need an interface for 'Users' but only include a few members

Optionally combine users with their todos and/or photos etc.
The available nested routes are:
    /posts/1/comments
    /albums/1/photos 
    /users/1/albums
    /users/1/todos
    /users/1/posts

Ideally, build the URL using back-tick interpolation

Show a nice collection of the users, and optionally their photos or their 'completed' todos
- e.g. on the web page (preferred)
- or use console.log and string interpolation within VS Code 
   
Handle exceptions (catch)
type-safe the Promise
use async/await

If you like, download the JSON and do it all offline (no fetch) or try NodeFetch (look it up).

As of Node 18, fetch is now in Node core so you don't need to add a 3rd party dependency like node-fetch.

Optional
========
Provide a way to parameterize which user to retrieve (i.e. ask in the web page)
How could you offer a filter (say photos by user or todos by complete)...

NB the API also permits fake delete, post and (real) filter - see the API documentation

consider making interfaces for Address etc. then compose the 'User' interface
